# Dynamic Research Slots Reborn - Mod Metadata
#
# This file contains mod metadata such as version information.
# This is called at the very start of initialization to set up compatibility signals.
#
# NOTE: When updating the mod version, update the version here to match descriptor.mod
# Version format: Major.Minor.Bugfix/Small changes (e.g., 1.1 for version 1.1.0)
# Personal Note: I will forget this file so often - sorry  ^-^

dr_set_mod_metadata = {
	# Set mod version for compatibility checks by other mods
	# Update this value when releasing a new version to match descriptor.mod
	set_variable = { dr_mod_version = 1.4 }
	
	# Signal that Dynamic Research Slots is active
	set_global_flag = dynamic_research_slots_active
}
