  # Detailed description used by the info decision
  dynamic_research_decision_desc:0 "Our factories generate Research Power (RP), which, when it reaches certain thresholds, unlocks more research slots for us to use - but we can also lose them if our RP is not high enough.\n\nÂ§YTotal RP:Â§! [?research_power|Y]\nÂ§O RP from civilian factories:Â§! [?rp_civilian|Y]\nÂ§G RP from military factories:Â§! [?rp_military|Y]\nÂ§C RP from naval dockyards:Â§! [?rp_naval|Y]"

  # Event notification titles, descriptions and option names.
  dynamic_research_growth_title:0 "The growth of research capacity"
  dynamic_research_growth_desc:0 "Economic growth will allow to invest more in research."
  dynamic_research_decline_title:0 "Research capacity decline"
  dynamic_research_decline_desc:0 "The economic downturn has led to a lack of research funding."

  # Startup notification localisation
  dynamic_research_startup_title:0 "Dynamic Research Slots Initialized"
  dynamic_research_startup_desc:0 "Dynamic Research Power is now active. Your factories will generate Research Power (RP) each day. When RP reaches certain thresholds, additional research slots will unlock automatically; if your RP falls below a threshold, slots may be lost. Keep growing your industrial capacity to maintain or increase your research efficiency."

  # Custom game rules

  RULE_DR_EASY_SLOTS:0 "Easy Research Slots (Base)"
  RULE_DR_EASY_SLOTS_DESC:0 "Controls how many additional Easy Research Slots each country starts with on top of the default behaviour. Easy slots are cheaper to maintain and require less Research Power to unlock."
  RULE_DR_EASY_SLOTS_DEFAULT:0 "Default"
  RULE_DR_EASY_SLOTS_DEFAULT_DESC:0 "Use the original Dynamic Research Slots logic. Only research slots granted at game start or via focuses count as Easy Slots."

  RULE_DR_EASY_SLOTS_PLUS_5_DESC:0 "Each country starts with five extra Easy Research Slots."

  RULE_DR_EASY_COST:0 "Easy Slot RP Cost Factor"
  RULE_DR_EASY_COST_DESC:0 "Controls how much Research Power Easy Slots require compared to normal slots. Lower values mean easier (cheaper) slots."
  RULE_DR_EASY_COST_10:0 "10% of normal cost"
  RULE_DR_EASY_COST_10_DESC:0 "Easy Research Slots require only 10% of the normal Research Power."
